i want to handpick creators who i will be          
  featuring on the website.. this will be an        
  incentive for creators to be featured from           time to time.. the scrolling area [Most            
  Engaging Creators] is where these should be          showing in the scroll.. create an                  
  administrator funtion that can be invoked from     
   the dashboard.. then pops up a modal where i      
  can add 10 creator pages who will shopw up in      
  this section. Put a small toggle button as         
  well for this funtion in the administrator         
  page whereby if this feature is toggle off         
  then this section picks up random channels         
  from the entire database
