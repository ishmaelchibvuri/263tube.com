Prompt for Claude: Admin Submission Management UI
Context: The submission pipeline is now generating high-quality PENDING_REQUEST items. I need the Admin Approval Dashboard to manage these requests.

Task 1: The Submissions Page (app/admin/submissions/page.tsx)

Access Control: Ensure this page uses the requireAdmin() server-side check.

Data Fetching: Fetch all items with PK starting with PENDING_REQUEST#.

UI Layout: Create a "Review Queue" using a clean table or list.

Show the Primary Profile Image fetched during validation.

Show the Verified Badges (YouTube, IG, etc.) so I can see at a glance if the data is real.

List the Selected Niches from the new taxonomy.

Task 2: The "Approval" Server Action (src/lib/actions/admin.ts) Create a processSubmission action that takes requestId and action ('APPROVE' or 'REJECT').

If APPROVE:

Copy the data from the PENDING_REQUEST item.

Create the official CREATOR#[slug] / METADATA record.

Set the status to ACTIVE.

Important: Delete the PENDING_REQUEST item to clear the queue.

If REJECT:

Delete the PENDING_REQUEST item.

(Optional) Log the rejection for audit purposes.

Task 3: Interactive Review Modal In the UI, when I click on a submission, open a modal that shows the Ecosystem Preview (the same one the user saw).

Add an "Edit Before Approval" feature: Let me tweak the Bio or Niche selection if the user made a mistake, before I hit the final "Approve" button.

Task 4: Post-Approval Revalidation Ensure the action calls revalidatePath('/') and revalidatePath('/creators') so the new creator appears on the homepage immediately.
