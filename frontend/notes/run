Context: The backend logic (DAL) and the UI components for 263Tube.com are complete, but the main pages are currently "Client Components" using mock data. We need to refactor these into Async Server Components to fetch real data from DynamoDB and ensure the site is SEO-optimized and production-ready.

Your Mission: Refactor the core pages to replace all mock data with real database calls from src/lib/creators.ts.

1. Home Page Refactor (app/page.tsx)

Action: Remove "use client" from the main page file.

Data Fetching:

Make the component async.

Fetch trendingCreators using getTopReferrers(3).

Fetch allCreators using getAllCreators().

Component Split: \* The "Podium" and "Grid" should receive this real data as props.

Extract the interactive Search & Filter Bar into a separate client component (e.g., src/components/creators/SearchFilters.tsx) so it can still handle user input without making the whole page a client component.

2. Profile Page Refactor (app/creator/[slug]/page.tsx)

Action: Convert to an async Server Component.

Logic:

Use params.slug to call getCreatorBySlug(slug).

If the creator is not found, return the Next.js notFound() function.

Mapping: Pass the real creator object into the existing SocialLinkGroup, StatsBadge, and Header components.

3. Directory & Trending Pages

Action: Perform similar refactors for /creators and /trending pages.

Ensure they call getAllCreators() and getTopReferrers() respectively.

4. Admin "Approval" Route (New Task)

Requirement: I need a way to see the submissions created by the submitCreatorRequest action.

Create Page: app/admin-portal-preview/page.tsx (Use a simple, un-styled list for now).

Logic: Call getPendingRequests() and display the submitted data.

Action: Add a simple "Approve" button that (conceptually or literally) triggers a Server Action to change the status of that creator to ACTIVE.

5. Verification:

Ensure revalidatePath("/") is working so that after a referral is tracked, the Server Component re-renders the home page with the updated count.

Deliverables:

Fully functional app/page.tsx and app/creator/[slug]/page.tsx with zero mock data.

A working (private) Admin route to view submissions.
