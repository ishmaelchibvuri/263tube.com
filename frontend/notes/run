Context: We are pivoting 263Tube from a directory to a Business Engine. We need to implement a "Business Inquiry" system that allows brands to contact creators directly through their profile pages.

Task 1: The Inquiry Server Action (src/lib/actions/inquiries.ts)

Create a server action submitBusinessInquiry(creatorSlug: string, formData: FormData).

Logic: \* Validate the input (Company Name, Email, Budget Range, Message).

Write the data to DynamoDB with PK: INQUIRY#slug and SK: INQUIRY#[timestamp].

Include a status: "PENDING" attribute.

Security: Implement a simple Honeypot or Rate Limiting to prevent spam bots from flooding creators.

Task 2: The "Work With Me" UI (app/creator/[slug]/page.tsx)

Add a prominent "Work With This Creator" button (High contrast, "Business" style).

This button should open a clean, professional Modal.

Form Fields:

Company Name / Name

Contact Email

Type of Collaboration (e.g., Video Shoutout, Event Hosting, Long-term Partnership)

Estimated Budget (Optional dropdown: $100-500, $500-2000, $2000+)

Message details.

Task 3: The Admin Inquiry Feed (app/admin/inquiries/page.tsx)

Create a view for the Admin to see all incoming inquiries across the whole platform.

This allows the Admin (Ishmael) to act as the "Agent" or moderator to ensure quality.

Task 4: Success State

After submission, show the brand a "Professional Confirmation" message: "Your inquiry has been sent to [Creator Name]. 263Tube helps facilitate these connections to ensure professional delivery."
