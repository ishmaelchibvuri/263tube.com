ORIGINAL COMPETITOR REVIEWS (FOR REFERENCE)

Danielle Rheeder

Been using the app for my studies, however, I spoke to a friend who used it last year who said that it is not up to date with the 2018 FAIS legislation. However, I have not seen that it is outdated. Writing my exam next month and wanted to get an early jump on the studies. So far, it has been very useful, however, it would be nice to see a scoring graph or perhaps have the questions broken down into the 3 categories that the RE exam is based on instead of all questions thrown together.

Thank you for the good review Kreveshan. Really appreciate it. Pls don't let paying put you off. Good products cost money to develop. Some people will be able to support their families if you pay and South Africa will become better and better if we support each other's good work.

Thank you for the good review Hlukar. The questions are similar to those you will find in the Moonstone exam but are not exactly the same.

This is one of the best if not the BEST. The fact that you can choose to see answers when you answer makes it so easy learn. It looks good, it is easy to use and has more questions than the others I have used. Truly happy with this one. 🤗
